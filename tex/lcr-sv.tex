\textbf{Background:}
Strcutural variants (SVs) refer to genomic differences between individuals that are $\ge$50bp in length.
They have profound influences on pheonotypes but are challenging to call even with long sequence reads.
\vspace{0.5em}\\
\textbf{Results:}
We evaluated the SV calling accuracy of several long-read SV callers, taking the latest HG002-Q100 benchmark as the ground truth.
We found that of $\sim$28,000 SVs in the confident regions of HG002, 69.1\% overlap with low-complexity regions (LCRs) covering 1.2\% of GRCh38.
Depending on long-read SV callers, 78.6--92.5\% of wrong SV calls overlap with LCRs.
The error rate is further increased with the length of LCRs.
In LCRs containing alleles longer than 2,000bp, the false positive and false negative rates reach 5.8--33.0\% and 7.8--53.7\%, respectively.
\vspace{0.5em}\\
\textbf{Conclusion:}
SVs are enriched and challenging to call around LCRs.
Special cares need to be taken for calling and analyzing SVs around long LCRs.

\section{Introduction}

Structural variants (SVs) are $\ge$50bp genomic variants
and may have functional impacts~\cite{Eichler:2019aa}.
Recent work based on high-quality long-read assemblies suggests
there are broadly 25,000--35,000 SVs per human individual~\cite{Liao:2023aa,Logsdon:2025ab}.
Constructed by the Genome-In-A-Bottle (GIAB) group,
the latest SV benchmark HG002-Q100 v1.1~\cite{Hansen2025.09.21.677443} contains 28,188 SVs in 2.76Gb of confident regions, consistent with the recent counts.
In contrast, published in 2020~\cite{Zook:2020aa}, the older HG002-SV benchmark v0.6 only contains 9,705 SVs in 2.66Gb.
This seems to suggest $\sim$18,000 SVs would fall in $\sim$100Mb regions if we assume the SV v0.6 regions are contained in Q100 v1.1.
Is this the correct interpretation?

This article gives the answer:
the differences between the two versions of the GIAB SV benchmarks
are primarily driven by low-complexity regions (LCRs) that harbor repeatedly occurring motifs.
The older benchmark excluded many of LCRs because it was hard to call them correctly.
Although SV callers developers have noticed the difficulties in calling SVs around LCRs~\cite{Zook:2020aa,Smolka:2024ab,Keskus:2025aa},
they have not systematically quantified the effect of LCRs in SV calling.
There is not a consensus on the number of SVs in LCRs or the error rate of them.
Here, we identified LCRs jointly from the reference genome
and the assemblies from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC)~\cite{Liao:2023aa},
and evaluated their impact on SV calling with multiple callers.

%Many SV callers have been developed~\cite{Kosugi:2019aa,Nardone:2025aa}
%due to the biomedical importance of SVs~\cite{Eichler:2019aa}.
%While callers based on short reads alone have been suggling with accuracy,
%callers based on long reads have shown promising results~\cite{Wenger:2019ab,Pei:2024aa}.

\section{Data Description}

\subsection{Generating low-complexity regions}

We applied longdust~\cite{Li:2025aa} to GRCh38 and identified 115.4Mb of LCRs on assembled chromosomes.
We filtered about half of them that overlap with alpha and HSAT2/3 centromeric repeats found by dna-brnn~\cite{Li:2019aa}.
34.4Mb of LCRs were left when we selected LCRs of 50bp or longer.

GRCh38 only represents one human genome.
It may miss polymorphic LCRs present in other human samples but missing from GRCh38.
To look for these LCRs, we ran longdust on all 462 assemblies by HPRC
and used the results to annotate variant bubbles in the minigraph graph of these assemblies~\cite{Li:2020aa}.
A variant bubble was marked as an LCR if (a) $\ge$70\% of the sequences in the bubble were LCRs in the source assemblies, and
(b) the sequences in the bubble were not annotated as segmental duplications (SegDup) by HPRC.
Note that if an LCR falls in a long polymorphic SegDup, most of the sequences in the corresponding bubble will be annotated as SegDup but not LCRs.
This is why we put SegDup at a higher priority over LCRs.
To focus on common variants, we dropped non-GRCh38 alleles supported by $<$5 assemblies.
We ignored HG002 when counting supports because we will use this sample for benchmarking later.

We merged the common polymorphic LCRs and GRCh38 LCRs and added 5bp to both ends of each LCR.
This resulted in a BED file with 111,067 records, covering 35.4Mb of GRCh38.
29,291 records overlap with common polymorphic LCRs in the HPRC minigraph graph.
3,918 of them are not observed on GRCh38.
16.2\% of the LCRs are intersected with the SegDup annotation from the ``genomicSuperDups'' track of the UCSC Genome Browser~\cite{Perez:2025aa}.

\subsection{Investigating the GIAB truth SVs}

There are 29,131 SVs of $\ge$50bp in length contained in the confident regions in the new HG002-Q100 v1.1 benchmark~\cite{Hansen2025.09.21.677443}.
943 of them have ``*'' as alternate alleles.
We manually inspected the read alignment around some of these SVs and believe they are all redundant.
Removing them from the truth left us with 28,188 SVs.
The truvari~\cite{English:2022aa} evaluation tool also filters SVs with ``*'' alleles.

The older HG002-SV v0.6 benchmark~\cite{Zook:2020aa} is only available for GRCh37.
To evaluate the SV calling accuracy on this benchmark,
we lifted its confident regions over to GRCh38
but we still took SVs from HG002-Q100 as the ground truth.
There are 11,985 HG002-Q100 overlapping with the lifted HG002-SV confident regions,
more than the 9,705 SVs from the older HG002-SV benchmark.
The difference is caused by the allele resolution.
Suppose both haplotypes in HG002 harbor a 6kb insertion to the same location of the reference genome.
The inserted sequences however differ by one SNP between them.
The newer HG002-Q100 benchmark
would consider this event as two heterozygous insertions,
but the older HG002-SV benchmark would merge the two insertion alleles and consider them as one homozyzgous insertion.
As a result, we counted 7,362 insertions in HG002-Q100 v1.1 but only 5,444 in HG002-SV v0.6.
The allele resolution may also affect deletions.
If there are overlapping deletions of similar lengths between the two haplotypes,
HG002-Q100 will encode them two independent deletions,
but HG002-SV may merge them and thus reduce the total counts.
Overall, constructed from long-read assemblies, HG002-Q100 is more precise and more accurate than HG002-SV.

\subsection{Calling structural variants}

We acquired PacBio High-Fidelity (HiFi) reads from HPRC~\cite{hifi-read},
aligned them to the primary assembly of GRCh38 with minimap2~\cite{Li:2018ab}
and called SVs with
cuteSV v2.1.1~\cite{Jiang:2020aa},
DeBreak v1.0.2~\cite{Chen:2023aa},
Delly v1.3.3~\cite{Rausch:2012aa},
longcallD v0.0.5~\cite{longcalld},
pbsv v2.11.0~\cite{pbsv},
Sawfish v0.12.10~\cite{Saunders:2025aa},
Severus v1.6~\cite{Keskus:2025aa},
Sniffles2 v2.6.3~\cite{Smolka:2024ab},
SVDSS v2.1.0~\cite{Denti:2023aa},
SVIM v2.0.0~\cite{Heller:2019aa}
and SVision-pro v2.4~\cite{Wang:2025aa}.
We dropped SVision-pro because it did not output SV alleles.
Severus under several settings all called $\sim$40\% fewer SVs in LCR than other callers.
We excluded it as an outlier.
Sniffles2 could optionally take tandem repeatitive regions as input,
but using this option slightly reduced its overall accuracy, so we only evaluated its default setting.

\section{Analyses}

\subsection{Most SVs are located in LCRs}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig1}
\caption{Number of HG002 structural variants (SVs) on GRCh38.
(A) Number of SVs in the HG002-Q100 v1.1 confident regions,
stratified by segmental duplications (SegDup),
low-complexity regions (LCRs) and the rest of the genome.
An SV is classified as SegDup (or LCR) if $\ge$70\% of its interval on GRCh38 overlap with SegDup (or LCR).
An SV classified as SegDup will not be classified as LCR.
(B) Number of HG002-Q100 SVs in the HG002-SV v0.6 confident regions lifted over from GRCh37.}\label{fig:count}
\end{figure}

We statified HG002 SVs by SegDup and LCR (Fig.~\ref{fig:count}).
We required $\ge$70\% of regions to overlap with SegDup or LCR.
Without this condition, a long deletion containing a short LCR would be falsely classified as LCR.
Similar to the generation of LCRs, an SV was classified as SegDup and LCR as a SegDup if it overlaps with both SegDup and LCR.
Out of 2,110 SegDup SVs in the HG002-Q100 truth set, 1,701 could be annotated as LCR if we prioritized on LCR first.
The majority of SegDup SVs are also LCR.

Whereas the numbers of ``Other'' SVs in the HG002-Q100 confident regions are similar across callers,
the numbers of LCR SVs differ greatly (Fig.~\ref{fig:count}A).
SV callers that attempt to produce haplotype-resolved SVs, such as longcallD and SVDSS, call noticeably more SVs in LCR and SegDup.
This trend is also observed in the older HG002-SV v0.6 confident regions (Fig.~\ref{fig:count}B).
However, there are much fewer SVs in LCR and almost none in SegDup, although the numbers of SVs
in Other regions are only reduced a little.
The main difference between HG002-Q100 and HG002-SV comes from LCRs.

\subsection{SVs in LCRs are harder to call correctly}

\begin{figure}[!tb]
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig2}
\caption{Accuracy of SV calls.
(A) False discovery rate (FDR) of SVs in the HG002-Q100 confident regions, measured by truvari in the ``refine'' mode.
(B) False negative rate (FNR) of SVs in HG002-Q100.
(C) FDR in the HG002-SV confident regions.
(D) FNR in HG002-SV.}\label{fig:acc}
\end{figure}

We evaluated SV calls with truvari v5.3.0~\cite{English:2022aa}.
Having explored multiple truvari options,
we settled on ``{\tt bench -{}-passonly -{}-pick ac -{}-dup-to-ins}''
followed by ``{\tt refine -{}-use-original-vcfs}''
as the resulting accuracy matched our manual inspection better.
We also stratified SV calling errors by SegDup and LCR (Fig.~\ref{fig:acc}).

On the new HG002-Q100 truth, 31.1--39.0\% of SVs are marked as ``Other'' (Fig.~\ref{fig:count}A),
but only 5.2--14.0\% of SV errors come from ``Other'' (Fig.~\ref{fig:acc}A and \ref{fig:acc}B).
This suggests the Other category is easier to call.
The majority of errors are located in LCRs.
Although the error rate is further increased in SegDup,
recall that the majority of SVs in SegDup fall in
